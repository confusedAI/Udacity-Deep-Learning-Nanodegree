##### Unit Testing
* Unit testing does not assure perfect code or results. There could still be some unresolved issues. The purpose of unit testing is to help avoid silly mistakes and improve code quality.

* Moreover, [unit testing(tutorial)](https://cgoldberg.github.io/python-unittest-tutorial/) is very good practice to ensure that our code is free from bugs & prevents us from wasting a lot of time while debugging minor problems as well as improves our code standards.

* I recommend you to continue using unit testing in every module that you write in future, to keep it clean and speed up your development. Unit testing is highly motivated in industries.
